The paintings depict Dora Maar,\n                Picasso's mistress and muse. The Weeping Woman paintings were\n                produced by Picasso in response to the bombing of Guernica in\n                the Spanish Civil War and are closely associated with the\n                iconography in his painting Guernica. Picasso was intrigued with\n                the subject of the weeping woman, and revisited the theme\n                numerous times that year.[3] The last version, created on 26\n                October 1937,[4] was the most elaborate of the series, and has\n                been housed in the collection of the Tate Modern in London since\n                1987. Another Weeping Woman painting created on 18 October 1937\n                is housed at the National Gallery of Victoria and was involved\n                in a high-profile political art theft.\n              </p>\n              <button class=\"preview__item-info unbutton\">+ Info</button>\n              <button class=\"preview__item-button\">Buy Tickets</button>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"preview__item\" id=\"preview-12\">\n            <button class=\"preview__item-back unbutton\">\n              <span>Back</span>\n            </button>\n            <div class=\"preview__item-imgwrap\">\n              <div class=\"preview__item-img\" style=\"background-image: url(/9d504fe2165a12c6b9fb4bd1efeee8b2.jpg)\"></div>\n            </div>\n            <h2 data-splitting=\"\" class=\"preview__item-title\">Guernica</h2>\n            <div class=\"preview__item-content\">\n              <div class=\"preview__item-meta\">\n                <span>Berlin, Germany</span><span>29/07/2025</span>\n              </div>\n              <p class=\"preview__item-description\">\n                Guernica (Spanish: [ɡeɾˈnika]; Basque: [ɡernika]) is a large\n                1937 oil painting by Spanish artist Pablo Picasso.[1][2] It is\n                one of his best-known works, regarded by many art critics as the\n                most moving and powerful anti-war painting in history.[3] It is\n                exhibited in the Museo Reina Sofía in Madrid.[4]\n              </p>\n              <button class=\"preview__item-info unbutton\">+ Info</button>\n              <button class=\"preview__item-button\">Buy Tickets</button>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"preview__item\" id=\"preview-13\">\n            <button class=\"preview__item-back unbutton\">\n              <span>Back</span>\n            </button>\n            <div class=\"preview__item-imgwrap\">\n              <div class=\"preview__item-img\" style=\"background-image: url(/1d7d8a30474584760de197b990509f10.jpg)\"></div>\n            </div>\n            <h2 data-splitting=\"\" class=\"preview__item-title\">The She Wolf</h2>\n            <div class=\"preview__item-content\">\n              <div class=\"preview__item-meta\">\n                <span>Sydney, Australia</span><span>19/07/2025</span>\n              </div>\n              <p class=\"preview__item-description\">\n                In the early 1940s Pollock, like many of his peers, explored\n                primeval or mythological themes in his work. The wolf in this\n                painting may allude to the animal that suckled the twin founders\n                of Rome, Romulus and Remus, in the myth of the city's birth. But\n                \"She-Wolf came into existence because I had to paint it\",\n                Pollock said in 1944.

In the late 1930s Pollock introduced imagery\n                based on totemic or mythic figures, ideographic signs, and\n                ritualistic events, which have been interpreted as pertaining to\n                the buried experiences and cultural memories of the psyche. The\n                Moon Woman suggests the example of Picasso, particularly his\n                Girl Before a Mirror of 1932. The palettes are similar, and both\n                artists describe a solitary standing female as if she had been\n                x-rayed, her backbone a broad black line from which her curving\n                contours originate. Frontal and profile views of the face are\n                combined to contrast two aspects of the self, one serene and\n                public, the other dark and interior.\n              </p>\n              <button class=\"preview__item-info unbutton\">+ Info</button>\n              <button class=\"preview__item-button\">Buy Tickets</button>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"preview__item\" id=\"preview-15\">\n            <button class=\"preview__item-back unbutton\">\n              <span>Back</span>\n            </button>\n            <div class=\"preview__item-imgwrap\">\n              <div class=\"preview__item-img\" style=\"background-image: url(/0167fe56892b3a25f2091d314190a51f.jpg)\"></div>\n            </div>\n            <h2 data-splitting=\"\" class=\"preview__item-title\">Steographic</h2>\n            <div class=\"preview__item-content\">\n              <div class=\"preview__item-meta\">\n                <span>Belgrade, Serbia</span><span>04/11/2025</span>\n              </div>\n              <p class=\"preview__item-description\">\n                Jackson Pollock’s Stenographic Figure, created in 1942, was\n                groundbreaking for American art during the 1940s. This painting\n                is regarded as a key example of abstract expressionism and\n                features free-associative doodles mixed with pictographic unity.\n                Compared to his earlier works, Stenographic Figure is more\n                colorful and vivid.\n              </p>\n              <button class=\"preview__item-info unbutton\">+ Info</button>\n              <button class=\"preview__item-button\">Buy Tickets</button>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"preview__item\" id=\"preview-16\">\n            <button class=\"preview__item-back unbutton\">\n              <span>Back</span>\n            </button>\n            <div class=\"preview__item-imgwrap\">\n              <div class=\"preview__item-img\" style=\"background-image: url(/33a7f8bbada19437dc7a5be1fe4ca56f.jpg)\"></div>\n            </div>\n            <h2 data-splitting=\"\" class=\"preview__item-title\">\n              Girl in front of mirror\n            </h2>\n            <div class=\"preview__item-content\">\n              <div class=\"preview__item-meta\">\n                <span>Moscow, Russia</span><span>10/08/2025</span>\n              </div>\n              <p class=\"preview__item-description\">\n                Girl before a Mirror (French: Jeune fille devant un miroir) is\n                an oil on canvas painting by Pablo Picasso, which he created in\n                1932. The painting is a portrait of Picasso's mistress and muse,\n                Marie-Thérèse Walter, who is depicted standing in front of a\n                mirror looking at her reflection.
